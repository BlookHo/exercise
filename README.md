# README
######--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background:

* A group event will be created by an user.
* The group event should run for a whole number of days e.g.. 30 or 60.
* There should be attributes to set and update the start, end or duration of the event
(and calculate the other value).
* The event also has a
  name,
  description (which supports formatting), ( ?? format: { with: /\A[a-zA-Z]+\z/,
                                                  message: "only allows letters" } ?? )
  location.
 
* The event should be draft or published.
* To publish all of the fields are required,
  it can be saved with only a subset of fields before itâ€™s published.
* When the event is deleted/remove it should be kept in the database and marked as such.

## Deliverable:
* Write an AR model, spec and migration for a GroupEvent
that would meet the needs of the description above.
 
* Then write the api controller and spec to
support JSON request/responses to manage these GroupEvents.

For the purposes of this exercise, ignore auth.

* Please provide your solution as a rails app called exercise_YYMMDD_yourname,
sent as a zip file.
